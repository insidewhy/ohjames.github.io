To make a good video game you need to play a lot of games. Megaman games are some of the best games on the planet. So I'm gonna beat every single Robot Master from every single Megaman game and rank them all here. I'm also beating every boss with the *megabuster alone*, no master weapons allowed. In games where you can choose between Bass, Megaman and Protoman I'm choosing Megaman. Despite taking double damage, I find the fights as Protoman way easier. The mobility the slide provides allows you to easily evade things that can be challenging to evade as Megaman.

I'll start with Megaman 10 (but I'll collect all these articles together at the end):

### Pump man

Difficulty: A+

You can't avoid getting hit in this battle. Your success will mostly be to luck but you can do a lot to improve your chances. The master does 1-4 jumps, about half are short hops, the other half are long jumps. After this he fires 9 curving projectiles that span the screen. Then repeat. That's it. The problem is, the short hop is impossible to avoid from mid distance. You have to be so far away he can't reach you, or really close so you can react to it and walk under him. That would be no problem except the projectiles have the opposite problem, the closer you are the harder they are to avoid. When the master does a short hop from close range followed by the projectiles you have almost no chance of avoiding the projectiles. If you try to stay far away at all times, the master might jump right next to you, and then do a short hop, now you're likely to get hit by the projectiles again. It gets worse, if the master manages to jump on top of you, and then follows that up with a short hop, you're almost definitely gonna be hit twice as you won't have enough time after the hit-stun to avoid the second short hop. Maybe he'll even do a third short hop in a row so you'll get hit three times and half your energy will be gone. The best strategy is to try to stay as close to him as possible at all times and then run like hell if you see him jump up to fire the projectiles. Half the time the projectiles are gonna hit you but they do less damage than the master's body so you'll be more likely to stay alive long enough to whittle his energy away. You can also shoot the projectiles off him while he is jumping, try to do this as much as possible so that the projectiles will be less likely to hit you.

On the positive side, I love the way he pumps his own head. Although it looks really... wrong. Masturbatory or something.

### Sheep man

Difficulty: F

I beat him on my second attempt (my first with full energy), his patterns are ridiculously easy to learn. When the clouds come up you might be lucky enough to be in a position where they won't even hit you. If you can't then timing your jump to hit the ground blast around wear the lightning strikes is pretty easy. As long as you are weary of the last lightning strike, which sends lightning out across the whole floor in both directions, you can easily beat him without taking damage.

### Strike man

Difficulty: C

The ball tracks you when it bounces so keep moving when you're ducking under his jumps (you can't just stay in the right location or the ball will definitely hit you). I'm pretty sure it's possible to avoid any damage but certain positions make it much harder to dodge both the master together with his ball e.g. if you get stuck against a side and he throws a ground shot towards you.

### Blade man

Difficulty: C+

It took me a while to learn this guy's routines but once you do it's fairly easy to take him out without taking a hit. When he jumps on the wall above you, if you do a short hop out in front of him and fall back below him it'll trick him into throwing his blades across the screen where they can't hit you. When he is on the opposite wall he'll either quickly transition to the top, or slowly jump towards you. I thought the latter was almost unblockable, but as soon as you realise the delay is longer when he charges at you, you can walk towards him and then jump in the opposite direction as he charges at your previous position. The projectiles themselves are fairly easy to avoid, you just need to learn where to stand. Defeating him unlocks my favourite weapon in Megaman 10, it's really useful and has low energy consumption.

### Commando Man

Difficulty: D

I had a lot of difficulty with this guy at first because I thought you had to time your jumps to both avoid the "ground shaking" affect as well as jump over the missle shockwaves. That's actually possible but the timing needed is ridiculous. Instead if you just run towards the missle to get it to drop and then jump backwards you'll avoid the hitstun from the ground shaking and be far enough away the shockwaves can't even touch you even when grounded. When he traps you at the side it's very easy to just walk underneath him while he hovers. I'm glad this master isn't so difficult because the stage is the hardest robot master stage in the game by a mile! There's so many ways things can push you into holes for an instant kill, especially annoying are the things that jump out of the holes as you try to jump over them. If I was ranking the stage and the master it'd be an A+, but the master himself is a cakewalk, although still not as pitiful as Sheepman.
