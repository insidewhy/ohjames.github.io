The old version is more charming I think and I like the way the characters look better. I like the use of SD and the exaggerated expressions. Crystal looks particularly awful in the first two seasons, the animation is much better in the most recent season. It started using SD characters in the gags and paying for more animator time, it's a better balance between authentic and looking good. Crystal changes the story in subtle ways I don't like, not that the manga is the best story in the world but my 14 year old self read the whole thing and loved it. It was cool the way they kept the four king's corpses hanging around in the manga, or how Sailor V attacks beryl with the sword. Maybe they had to tone it down for the anime? Spooky/fierce stuff became banal. I give the most recent season a much better mark than the seasons before it but I much prefer the original anime.

 * Sailor Moon (excluding Super S) - Gold
 * Sailor Moon Crystal Season III - Honourable Mention
