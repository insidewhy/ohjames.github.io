I have been using node-orm2 recently. These are my findings:

1. Promises are the best way to handle asynchronous results now, especially with the advent of [async/await](https://blog.risingstack.com/async-await-node-js-7-nightly/). Yet async/await won't help you with node-orm2 because it uses callbacks everywhere. Sure you can use a library like [async](https://github.com/caolan/async) to avoid [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/) but promises are much better (even when discounting async/await) because they are [composable](https://gist.github.com/domenic/3889970). This is why they are part of every new HTML5 proposal involving asynchronous results (e.g. the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)). Worse: node-orm [provide its own incompatible class called Promise](https://github.com/dresende/node-orm2/blob/v3.2.3/lib/Promise.js) which it uses to overrides the built-in implementation and it isn't anywhere near as useful or performant as native promises.
1. The library does [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) all wrong. Instead of using ES6 classes or `prototype` it assigns a new copy of each method in the [constructor](https://github.com/dresende/node-orm2/blob/v3.2.3/lib/Model.js#L205) [one](https://github.com/dresende/node-orm2/blob/v3.2.3/lib/Model.js#L223) by [one](https://github.com/dresende/node-orm2/blob/v3.2.3/lib/Model.js#L251). This is *very* bad for memory usage, performance and extensability.
1. As a consequence of the previous point, you cannot extend any classes provided or created by orm2. You must use the orm2 API to create custom methods on your API, where again they won't be added to the prototype of the model but as instance members.
1. It's [slow](https://github.com/rafaelkaufmann/q-orm/issues/1#issuecomment-64449143) and the API is [non-uniform](https://github.com/rafaelkaufmann/q-orm/issues/1#issuecomment-64442225).
1. The documentation is incomplete, some things are only documented on [github](https://github.com/dresende/node-orm2/blob/v3.2.3/Readme.md) and others are only documented on the [wiki](https://github.com/dresende/node-orm2/wiki).
1. It is not an active project, there were only [24 commits last year](https://github.com/dresende/node-orm2/commits/master) and some PR have [been open for over 2 years without response](https://github.com/dresende/node-orm2/pull/574).
1. It [bundles all supported database drivers](https://github.com/dresende/node-orm2/tree/v3.2.3/lib/Drivers/DML) and other utilities you may or may not need like a [middleware for express](https://github.com/dresende/node-orm2/blob/v3.2.3/lib/Express.js).
1. Many annoying niggles, e.g. after closing one database connection is it impossible to create a new connection.

Lately I've been [questioning if ORMs are a good idea](http://www.bigdatalittlegeek.com/blog/2014/3/18/orm-the-killer-of-scalability). I've also been looking at [sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/v3/), a project that has recently become much more active than orm2. It provide a better promise based API and better documentation. I've also used [mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose) in the past which is a reasonable choice when you are using mongo (but before choosing mongo always [make sure it fits your data](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)).
