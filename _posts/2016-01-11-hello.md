Blog by James of [chilon.net](http://chilon.net). I will be mostly writing about:

 * Anime for adults
 * Film, Music and TV from outside of the mainstream
 * Programming
   * JavaScript
     * nodejs
     * EcmaScript 2016
     * Aurelia
     * Polymer, Ember and Angular
   * Ruby and Crystal
   * C++
   * Scala
 * Best things
 * And stuff

A list of fruits you would not like to take care of as if they were your own son:

 * Banana (mould)
 * Kiwi (also mould)
 * Green Tomato (unconvincing)
 * Durian (stinky even when fresh)

More acceptable fruits for this responsibility:

 * Chestnut
 * Groundnuts
