[chilon.net](http://chilon.net) is a consultancy of highly skilled, highly experienced, polyglot developers. In our five years of business we have been working mostly with: JavaScript, react, redux, TypeScript, node.js, python, angular 2-7, scss, styled components, webpack, create-react-app, ng-cli, SQL (mysql/postgres), redis and NoSQL (mongo, rethinkdb). All of our projects use containers via docker/docker-compose, and most are deployed to kubernetes clusters. We've worked mostly with AWS and digital ocean but also have some GCloud experience. We are functional programming experts with advanced knowledge of rxjs, ngrx, redux and functional reactive programming. We have been using a pragmatic approach to TDD for the last decade and all of our JavaScript/TypeScript projects are unit tested with jest, mocha or jasmine with CI usually handled by CircleCI.

We help companies architecture greenfield cloud based technology platforms (especially full-stack websites) and then lead the development, structuring work using a pragmatic take on Agile methodology. We also have experience rescuing troubled projects and refactoring existing codebases to follow current best practices. We have particularly strong experience in the areas of visualisation including interactive media; with a great deal of experience in Canvas, D3 and WebSocket. Our open source library rxjs-websockets is the most popular rxjs WebSocket implementation with many thousand downloads per week.

We are also occasionally developing Android software using kotlin and working on embedded hardware projects using c#, c++ and python.

We embrace new technologies and approaches, we have open source projects using flutter, rkt, WebGL, rust, c++14 and c. We also frequently contribute back to high-profile (and low-profile!) open source projects.

We have worked with Goldsmiths College Interactive Research Studio, The Press Association, Bulb, WeAreEverywhere, TicketText, ClickOn Media and Dectech.

We are currently working on a new project and are not available for consulting work until July 2019.
